Hey hey welcome to Adem R.N. Aouichaoui's personal page! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

Previousely a postdoctoral researcher at the [Process Systems Engineering center PROSYS](https://www.kt.dtu.dk/research/prosys), [Department of chemical & biochemical
engineering](https://www.kt.dtu.dk/) at the [Technical University of Denmark (DTU)](https://www.dtu.dk/english/) and currently seeking new challenges within academia in 
applying data-driven methods for molecular science and process systems engineering (PSE).

During my Ph.D. i worked with developping and applying Graph Neural Networks for pure componenent property prediction. the work was carried out under thr supervision of [Prof. GÃ¼rkan Sin](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/g%C3%BCrkan-sin) and [Assoc. prof. Jens Abildskov](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/jens-abildskov). The properties target are of great importance to a wide range of diciplices such as phase equilibria, reaction engineering, enviromental/risk assessment and solvetn screening. The general aim is to provide new tools for solvent screening that genralize better and describe a larger portion of the chemical design space.
A main contribution was the development of GroupGAT and AGC, two interporetable GNN models that leverages the concept of functional groups (known from the group-contribution models) to highlight parts of the molecules with highest impact on the laten representation produced by the GNN. these insights were confirmed by chemistry knwoledge.
