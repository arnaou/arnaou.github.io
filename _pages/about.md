This is Adem R.N. Aouichaoui's home on the web!

Currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Process Systems Engineering center (PROSYS)](https://www.kt.dtu.dk/research/prosys),
at Department of chemical & biochemical engineering of the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). Currently, I am working
with molecular property modelling using emperical approaches such as group-contribution methods as well as data-driven 
machine-learning based methods such as Graph Neural Networks. The ultimate aim is to develop fast and efficient screening
tools that enables an informed and rationale decision-making process.
