Abstract:
In this study we apply automatic outlier detection to improve a total of 18 pure componenet group-contribution models.
The properties include: boiling/melting/critical temperatures, critical pressure/volume, acentric factors, Solubility parameters (Hansen/Hildebrand), enthalpies of formation/vaporization etc.
