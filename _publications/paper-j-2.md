excerpt: 'In this paper we investigate three model agnostic approaches to uncertainty estimation of graph neural networks: ensemble, bootstrap and monte carlo dropout. these techniques were benchmarked on two GNN models and three pure component properties: the critical temperature, pressure and volume.'

Deep learning and graph-based models have gained popularity in various life scienceapplications such as property modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance.However, the quantification of prediction uncertainty in these models is less studiedand is not applied in the low dataset size regime, which characterizes many chemicalengineering-related molecular properties. In this work, we apply two graph-basedmodels to model the critical- temperature, pressure, and volume and apply threetechniques (the bootstrap, the ensemble, and the dropout) to quantify the predictionuncertainty. The overall model confidence is evaluated using the coverage. Theresults suggest that graph-based models perform better compared with currentgroup-contribution-based property modeling techniques while eliminating thetedious task of developing molecular descriptors.
